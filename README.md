<h1 align="center">Calculator</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This Java calculator came to life as part of my journey into mastering language syntax, guided by J. Fain's Java Programming book.
It serves as a hands-on application of the concepts I learned. Using the Swing library, the project showcases the implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI).
Upon completing the book, I delved into the principles of writing clean and maintainable code. 
To my discernment, the original code for this calculator project fell short of these ideals. 
Thus, I embarked on the journey of refactoring, marking a pivotal step in my pursuit of refined coding practices.
Refactoring, especially for someone new to the concept, posed a formidable challenge. At that early learning stage, notions like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism were still finding their place. 
Despite the hurdles, I managed to uplift the codebase by introducing new methods and simplifying the overall structure. Rigorous unit testing validated the effectiveness of these improvements.
While the final outcome may not be a perfect match to my aspirations, this project stands as a significant marker in my growth. It underscores my commitment to continuous improvement and the application of best practices in software development.
